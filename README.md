# Litex on Alchitry Cu

This repo contains examples of using Litex on the Alchitry Cu board. I created this repo as there are very few examples for the Alchitry Cu board

Some of the examples are ported from the [FPGA 101 repo](https://github.com/litex-hub/fpga_101.git) from Litex hub. Credits to the authors for making this awesome project.

**Prerequisites**

1. Litex - https://github.com/enjoy-digital/litex/wiki/Installation
2. Project ICEStorm

## Examples

1. Blinky: Blinky example based on Lab002/blinker in FPGA 101

**Status:** Tested on board

2. SoC: SoC example based on Lab003 in FPGA 101 ported for Alchitry Cu

**Status:** Tested on board

3.
